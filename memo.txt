1.   'if' statements follow the "false-first" rule.
2.   Instance attribute is never assigned nor deleted out of the class methods.
3.   In class methods, every instance attribute is pulled to the local whenever referenced and pushed at the end whenever assigned. This is to guarantee a structured handling of attributes, viewing instance as another small namespace, in which we can stash objects for later use.
